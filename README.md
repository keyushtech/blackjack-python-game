# Blackjack Game üé≤  

A Python implementation of the classic **Blackjack (21)** card game, built as the **Day 11 Capstone** from Angela Yu‚Äôs *100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp*.  

## üìå Features  
- Player vs Computer (Dealer) gameplay.  
- Dealer automatically draws until reaching a score of ‚â•17.  
- Ace (`11`) adjusts to `1` when total score exceeds 21.  
- Detects **Blackjack** (Ace + 10 in the first two cards).  
- ASCII art logo for a polished feel.  
- Replay option to keep playing multiple rounds.  

## üéÆ Game Rules  
1. Both player and dealer start with 2 cards.  
2. Player chooses to **Hit** (draw another card) or **Stand** (end turn).  
3. If the player‚Äôs score > 21 ‚Üí **Bust** (lose immediately).  
4. If the player stands, the dealer draws until their score is ‚â• 17.  
5. Closest to 21 without going over wins.  
6. Natural Blackjack (Ace + 10 on first two cards) beats any other 21.
